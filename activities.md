# Limit Programming Language - Development Activities

## Project Overview
The Limit Programming Language is a modern programming language with features like static typing, optional parameters, concurrency primitives, and error handling. This document tracks the development activities and progress of the language implementation.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into frontend and backend components:

- **Frontend**: Responsible for lexical analysis (scanning) and syntax analysis (parsing)
  - `frontend/scanner.hh/cpp`: Tokenizes source code into a stream of tokens
  - `frontend/parser.hh/cpp`: Parses tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

- **Backend**: Responsible for semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation
  - `backend/backend.cpp`: Defines backend interfaces and implementations for bytecode generation
  - `backend/vm.hh/cpp`: Implements a virtual machine for executing bytecode
  - Includes bytecode generation and AST visualization

- **Shared**:
  - `ast.hh`: Defines the Abstract Syntax Tree structure
  - `opcodes.hh`: Defines bytecode operation codes
  - `debugger.hh`: Provides error reporting functionality
  - `memory.hh`: Provides memory management functionality
  - `value.hh`: Defines the value system for runtime values
  - `types.hh`: Defines the type system for static typing
