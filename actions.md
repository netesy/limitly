## Implementation Notes

### AST Structure
The AST is designed to represent all language constructs in a hierarchical structure:
- Program is the root node containing statements
- Statements include variable declarations, function declarations, control flow, etc.
- Expressions include literals, variables, operators, function calls, etc.

### Parser Implementation
The parser uses recursive descent parsing with the following key components:
- Token stream from the scanner
- AST node creation for each language construct
- Error handling and recovery

### Bytecode Generation
The bytecode generator visits the AST and generates bytecode instructions:
- Stack-based operations for expressions
- Control flow instructions for statements
- Function and class definitions
- Error handling and concurrency primitives

### Virtual Machine
The VM executes bytecode instructions:
- Uses a stack-based architecture
- Integrates with the memory manager for efficient memory usage
- Supports various data types through the type system
- Implements control flow, arithmetic, and comparison operations

### Memory Management
The memory manager provides:
- Efficient allocation and deallocation of memory
- Memory regions for scoped allocations
- Memory analysis for detecting leaks and inefficiencies
- Linear and reference-counted memory models

### Build System
The build system uses Zig's build system to:
- Compile C++ code with C++17 standard
- Link against the C++ standard library
- Build multiple executables (main and test_parser)
- Set up include paths for different components
- Provide run steps for easy execution

### Future Optimizations
- Constant folding
- Dead code elimination
- Register allocation
- Inlining
- Tail call optimization

## Action 8: Integrated VM Execution in REPL

**Changes Made**:
- Updated main.cpp to integrate VM execution for both file execution and REPL mode
- Added proper error handling for VM execution
- Enhanced REPL output to show execution results with "=>" prefix
- Added necessary includes and memory management for VM integration

**Files Modified**:
- main.cpp: Updated to use VM for code execution
- Added VM integration in both executeFile and startRepl functions
- Added proper error handling and result display

**Impact**:
- The REPL now executes code using the VM
- Users can see the results of their expressions directly in the REPL
- Error handling provides meaningful feedback for runtime errors
- The execution environment is properly initialized for each REPL input

## Action 9: Fixed Nested Iteration Critical Bug

**Prompt**: "from this we can see that nexsted Iteration seems to have an issue"

**Problem Identified**:
- Nested `iter` statements were failing with "Runtime error: Expected iterator value"
- The VM only had a single `tempValue` variable for storing iterators
- Inner loops were overwriting outer loop iterator state, causing corruption

**Changes Made**:
- **Enhanced VM temp variable system**: Changed from single `tempValue` to `std::vector<ValuePtr> tempValues`
- **Updated temp handlers**: Modified `handleStoreTemp`, `handleLoadTemp`, and `handleClearTemp` to use instruction indices
- **Added temp variable counter**: Added `tempVarCounter` to `BytecodeGenerator` class to track unique temp variable indices
- **Fixed iteration bytecode generation**: Modified `visitIterStatement` to use unique temp indices for each nested iteration

**Files Modified**:
- backend/vm.hh: Changed `tempValue` to `std::vector<ValuePtr> tempValues`
- backend/vm.cpp: Updated temp handlers to use indexed access
- backend.hh: Added `tempVarCounter` to `BytecodeGenerator`
- backend/backend.cpp: Modified `visitIterStatement` to use unique temp indices

**Impact**:
- âœ… Nested `iter` statements now work correctly for any level of nesting
- âœ… Each nested iteration gets its own temp variable slot
- âœ… No more iterator state corruption between nested loops
- âœ… Comprehensive testing shows perfect execution: (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,10), (2,11), (2,12)

## Action 10: Fixed String Interpolation Parser Bug

**Prompt**: "fix the string interpolation issue"

**Problem Identified**:
- Strings starting with interpolation (like `"{i}, {j}"`) were causing parser errors
- The parser expected STRING â†’ INTERPOLATION_START pattern but got INTERPOLATION_START directly
- Scanner was not generating initial STRING token for strings beginning with interpolation

**Changes Made**:
- **Added INTERPOLATION_START handling**: Added new case in `primary()` method to detect direct INTERPOLATION_START tokens
- **Enhanced interpolated string parsing**: Created logic to handle strings that start immediately with interpolation
- **Fixed parser flow**: Added proper handling for empty initial string part in interpolated strings

**Files Modified**:
- frontend/parser.cpp: Added new case for handling INTERPOLATION_START tokens directly

**Impact**:
- âœ… All string interpolation patterns now work correctly:
  - `"text {expr} more text"` âœ…
  - `"Value: {expr}"` âœ…  
  - `"{expr}, {expr2}"` âœ… (This was the broken case)
  - `"{expr} text {expr2}"` âœ…
- âœ… No more syntax errors for interpolation at string start
- âœ… Nested for loops with string interpolation work perfectly

## Action 11: Comprehensive Test Suite Organization

**Prompt**: "move all the test code to a new test folder and write test code for every well implemented feature of the language"

**Changes Made**:
- **Created organized test structure**: Built comprehensive test directory with 8 categories
- **Moved existing tests**: Relocated all test files to appropriate directories
- **Created 20+ test files**: Comprehensive coverage of all implemented features
- **Built test infrastructure**: Created automated test runners and documentation

**Test Structure Created**:
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ basic/              # Variables, literals, control flow, print statements
â”œâ”€â”€ expressions/        # Arithmetic, comparison, logical, ranges
â”œâ”€â”€ strings/           # Interpolation and string operations
â”œâ”€â”€ loops/             # For loops, iter loops, while loops
â”œâ”€â”€ functions/         # Basic and advanced function features
â”œâ”€â”€ classes/           # OOP features and inheritance
â”œâ”€â”€ concurrency/       # Parallel and concurrent blocks
â””â”€â”€ integration/       # Comprehensive and error handling tests
```

**Files Created**:
- **20+ test files** covering all implemented features
- **tests/run_tests.bat**: Automated test runner (silent mode)
- **tests/run_tests_verbose.bat**: Verbose test runner with output
- **tests/README.md**: Comprehensive test documentation

**Impact**:

- âœ… Easy identification of working vs. unimplemented features
- âœ… Automated test execution with pass/fail reporting
- âœ… Clear documentation for adding new tests
- âœ… Foundation for continuous integration testing

## Current Status Summary

- Print statements
- Range expressions (1..5)

### ðŸ”§ Recently Fixed Critical Issues
- **Nested iteration**: Complete fix for iterator state management
- **String interpolation**: Parser now handles all interpolation patterns
- **Test infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite with automated runners

## Action 12: Fixed Critical Variable Access Bug After Print Statements

**Prompt**: "from the control flow test we can see after the first use of a variable we get an error when we try to access the same variable"

**Problem Identified**:
- After executing `if` statements with `print` inside, subsequent variable access failed with "Cannot compare values of different types"
- The issue occurred specifically when: `if (x > y) { print(...); }` followed by `if (x < y) { ... }`
- Variables `x` and `y` were being corrupted or returning wrong types on second access

**Root Cause Found**:
- `print` statements were pushing `nil` onto the stack as a return value
- This `nil` value was interfering with subsequent operations
- The VM's `handlePrint` method had: `push(memoryManager.makeRef<Value>(*region, typeSystem->NIL_TYPE));`

**Changes Made**:
- **Fixed print statement stack behavior**: Removed the `push(nil)` from `handlePrint` method
- **Reasoning**: `print` is a statement, not an expression, so it shouldn't return a value
- **Updated comment**: Added explanation that print doesn't push a result

**Files Modified**:
- backend/vm.cpp: Removed `push(nil)` from `handlePrint` method

**Impact**:
- âœ… **Control flow tests now work perfectly**: All if/else statements execute correctly
- âœ… **Variable access after print statements**: No more type comparison errors
- âœ… **All control flow features working**: Simple if, if-else, if-else-if-else chains, nested if statements
- âœ… **Boolean operators working**: `and`, `or`, `!` operators work correctly
- âœ… **Test suite improvement**: Control flow test now passes completely

**Testing Results**:
- Before fix: "Runtime error: Cannot compare values of different types" after first if statement
- After fix: Complete control flow test executes successfully with all branches working
