# Limit Programming Language - Development Actions

This document tracks the specific actions taken during the development of the Limit Programming Language, serving as a prompt memory for future development.

## Action 1: Initial Analysis and Understanding

**Prompt**: "using sample.lm as the syntax to parse, rebuild the parser class to parse to AST"

**Changes Made**:
- Analyzed the sample.lm file to understand the language syntax
- Examined the existing parser implementation that was generating bytecode
- Created a comprehensive AST structure in ast.hh
- Implemented the parser methods to build this AST from the token stream
- Created a test program to demonstrate the parser in action

**Files Modified/Created**:
- Created ast.hh with AST node definitions
- Updated parser.hh and parser.cpp to generate AST instead of bytecode
- Created test_parser.cpp to test the parser

## Action 2: Code Organization - Frontend/Backend Separation

**Prompt**: "separate the code into frontend and backend components, where the scanners and parsers are frontend code for the compiler or backend"

**Changes Made**:
- Reorganized the codebase into frontend and backend folders
- Moved scanner and parser to the frontend folder
- Created backend implementation for bytecode generation
- Moved AST definition to a shared location
- Created a debugger implementation
- Created opcodes.hh to define bytecode operations
- Updated build system to reflect the new structure
- Created documentation files

**Files Modified/Created**:
- Created frontend/scanner.hh and frontend/scanner.cpp
- Created frontend/parser.hh and frontend/parser.cpp
- Created backend/backend.cpp
- Created ast.hh (shared)
- Created opcodes.hh
- Created debugger.hh and debugger.cpp
- Updated CMakeLists.txt
- Created main.cpp
- Updated README.md
- Created activities.md

## Action 3: Cleanup and Documentation

**Prompt**: "remove the unused files and using the activities.md follow the next step and create a actions.md"

**Changes Made**:
- Identified and removed unused files
- Created actions.md to track development actions and changes

**Files Removed**:
- Removed duplicate scanner.cpp and scanner.hh from root directory
- Removed duplicate parser.cpp and parser.hh from root directory
- Removed statements.h (replaced by ast.hh)
- Removed syntax.cpp and syntax.hh (functionality moved to parser)
- Removed stack.cpp and stack.hh (functionality moved to backend)
- Removed register.cpp and register.hh (functionality moved to backend)
- Removed repl.cpp and repl.hh (functionality moved to main.cpp)

## Action 4: Virtual Machine Implementation

**Prompt**: "integrate the memory manager, in memory.hh, memory_analyzer.hh, value.hh and types.hh to this code"

**Changes Made**:
- Implemented a virtual machine (VM) in the backend folder
- Integrated the memory manager from memory.hh
- Integrated the memory analyzer from memory_analyzer.hh
- Integrated the value system from value.hh
- Integrated the type system from types.hh
- Implemented basic VM operations (stack manipulation, arithmetic, etc.)
- Implemented control flow operations (jumps, conditionals)
- Added placeholder implementations for more complex operations

**Files Modified/Created**:
- Created backend/vm.hh with VM class definition
- Created backend/vm.cpp with VM implementation
- Updated actions.md to track progress

## Action 5: Build System Update

**Prompt**: "update the build.zig to build the code"

**Changes Made**:
- Updated the build.zig file to build the reorganized code structure
- Added support for building both the main executable and test_parser
- Configured C++17 standard for all source files
- Set up include paths for the frontend, backend, and shared components
- Added run steps for both executables

**Files Modified/Created**:
- Updated build.zig with new build configuration

## Action 6: Enhanced Type System

**Prompt**: "add structural types to typeAnnotations" and "in the structural type Extensible records with ... allowing additional fields"

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced the type annotation system to support structural types
- Added support for extensible records with `...` allowing additional fields (row polymorphism)
- Implemented union types (e.g., `int | float`)
- Implemented intersection types (e.g., `HasName and HasAge`)
- Added support for refined types with constraints (e.g., `int where value > 0`)
- Added support for range expressions (e.g., `1..10`)
- Implemented compound assignment operators (e.g., `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- Updated the AST structure to use shared pointers for type annotations
- Updated the backend to work with the enhanced AST structure

**Files Modified/Created**:
- Updated frontend/ast.hh with new type annotation structures
- Updated frontend/parser.hh and frontend/parser.cpp to parse the new type annotations
- Updated backend/backend.cpp to handle the new AST structures
- Updated backend.hh to include new visitor methods

## Implementation Notes

### AST Structure
The AST is designed to represent all language constructs in a hierarchical structure:
- Program is the root node containing statements
- Statements include variable declarations, function declarations, control flow, etc.
- Expressions include literals, variables, operators, function calls, etc.

### Parser Implementation
The parser uses recursive descent parsing with the following key components:
- Token stream from the scanner
- AST node creation for each language construct
- Error handling and recovery

### Bytecode Generation
The bytecode generator visits the AST and generates bytecode instructions:
- Stack-based operations for expressions
- Control flow instructions for statements
- Function and class definitions
- Error handling and concurrency primitives

### Virtual Machine
The VM executes bytecode instructions:
- Uses a stack-based architecture
- Integrates with the memory manager for efficient memory usage
- Supports various data types through the type system
- Implements control flow, arithmetic, and comparison operations

### Memory Management
The memory manager provides:
- Efficient allocation and deallocation of memory
- Memory regions for scoped allocations
- Memory analysis for detecting leaks and inefficiencies
- Linear and reference-counted memory models

### Build System
The build system uses Zig's build system to:
- Compile C++ code with C++17 standard
- Link against the C++ standard library
- Build multiple executables (main and test_parser)
- Set up include paths for different components
- Provide run steps for easy execution

### Future Optimizations
- Constant folding
- Dead code elimination
- Register allocation
- Inlining
- Tail call optimization
