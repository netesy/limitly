# The Zen of Limit

*Explicit is better than implicit.*

*Errors are not exceptions; they are values to be handled.*

*Concurrency should be structured, not chaotic.*

*Safety should not be a sacrifice for performance.*

*Clarity is king; code is read more often than it is written.*

*The absence of a value is a case to be handled, not a `nil` to be feared.*

*If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.*

*If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.*

*Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those.*

*Readability counts.*

*Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.*

*Although practicality beats purity.*

*In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.*

*There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.*

*Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're a Limiter.*

*Now is better than never.*

*Although never is often better than *right* now.*
