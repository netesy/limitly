// Comprehensive test for enhanced error reporting

// Test 1: Basic syntax that should work
let x: int = 42;
print(x);

// Test 2: Undefined variable (should show enhanced semantic error)
print(undefinedVar);

// Test 3: Type mismatch (if we had type checking enabled)
// let y: str = 123;  // This would be a type error

// Test 4: Division by zero (should show enhanced runtime error)
let result = x / 0;
