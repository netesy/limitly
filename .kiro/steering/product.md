# Limit Programming Language

Limit is a modern programming language designed with static typing, concurrency primitives, and memory safety features. The language combines the performance of systems programming with the safety and expressiveness of modern language design.

## Key Features
- Static typing with type inference
- Optional parameters and null safety
- Built-in concurrency (parallel/concurrent blocks)
- Async/await for asynchronous programming
- Pattern matching and enums
- Error handling with attempt-handle blocks
- Memory management with controlled unsafe operations
- Contract programming for compile-time and runtime safety

## Target Use Cases
- Systems programming with safety guarantees
- Concurrent and parallel applications
- Applications requiring both performance and safety
- Projects needing controlled low-level memory access

## Current Status
The project is in active development with a working frontend (scanner/parser) and partial backend (bytecode generation/VM). The language specification is comprehensive but implementation is ongoing.
