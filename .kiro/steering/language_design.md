# Language Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

Limit is designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Safety without sacrifice**: Provide memory and type safety without sacrificing performance
2. **Explicit over implicit**: Prefer explicit code that clearly states intent
3. **Controlled power**: Allow unsafe operations but only in controlled contexts
4. **Concurrency by design**: Built-in primitives for concurrent and parallel programming
5. **Pragmatic features**: Focus on features that solve real-world problems

## Type System

### Static Typing with Inference
- Strong static typing with type inference where possible
- Explicit type annotations for function signatures
- Generics for type-safe containers and algorithms

### Type Hierarchy
- Primitive types: `int`, `uint`, `float`, `bool`, `str`
- Composite types: `list`, `dict`, `tuple`
- User-defined types: classes, enums, interfaces
- Union types: `T | U`
- Refined types: `T where condition`

## Memory Model

### Memory Safety
- No null pointers by default (use `Union instead)
- No dangling references (ownership system)
- No uninitialized variables

### Controlled Unsafe Operations
- Unsafe blocks for low-level memory operations
- Contract programming for runtime and compile-time checks
- Memory analyzers for detecting potential issues

## Concurrency Model

### Parallel Execution
- `parallel` blocks for CPU-bound tasks
- Automatic work distribution across cores
- Thread-safe data structures

### Concurrent Execution
- `concurrent` blocks for I/O-bound tasks
- Channels for communication between tasks
- Atomic operations for shared state

### Asynchronous Programming
- `async`/`await` for non-blocking operations
- Future/Promise-based concurrency
- Structured concurrency with scoped tasks

## Error Handling

### Attempt-Handle Pattern
- `attempt` blocks for operations that might fail
- `handle` clauses for different error types
- No uncaught exceptions

### Result Types
- `Result<T, E>` for operations that might fail
- `Option<T>` for values that might be absent
- Pattern matching for handling different outcomes

## Code Organization

### Modules and Imports
- Module system for code organization
- Explicit imports for dependencies
- Visibility controls (`@public`, `@private`, `@protected`)

### Interfaces and Traits
- Interfaces for defining behavior contracts
- Traits for adding behavior to existing types
- Mixins for code reuse

## Syntax Design

### Readability
- Braces for blocks
- Semicolons for statement termination
- Type annotations after identifiers (`name: type`)

### Expressiveness
- Pattern matching with `match` expressions
- String interpolation with `{variable}`
- Named arguments for function calls
- Optional parameters with default values
