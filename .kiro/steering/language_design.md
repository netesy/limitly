# Language Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

Limit is designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Safety without sacrifice**: Provide memory and type safety without sacrificing performance
2. **Explicit over implicit**: Prefer explicit code that clearly states intent
3. **Controlled power**: Allow unsafe operations but only in controlled contexts
4. **Concurrency by design**: Built-in primitives for concurrent and parallel programming
5. **Pragmatic features**: Focus on features that solve real-world problems

## Type System

### Static Typing with Inference
- Strong static typing with type inference where possible
- Explicit type annotations for function signatures
- Generics for type-safe containers and algorithms

### Type Hierarchy ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Primitive types: `int`, `uint`, `float`, `bool`, `str` ✅
- Type aliases: `type Id = uint;` ✅
- Union types: `T | U` ✅
- Option types: `Some | None` ✅
- Optional parameters: `str?`, `int?` ✅
- Composite types: `list`, `dict`, `tuple` (planned)
- User-defined types: classes, enums, interfaces (in progress)
- Refined types: `T where condition` (planned)

## Memory Model

### Memory Safety ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- No null pointers by default (use Option types instead) ✅
- Region-based memory management ✅
- No uninitialized variables (compile-time checking) ✅
- No dangling references (ownership system) - in progress

### Controlled Unsafe Operations
- Unsafe blocks for low-level memory operations
- Contract programming for runtime and compile-time checks
- Memory analyzers for detecting potential issues

## Concurrency Model

### Parallel Execution
- `parallel` blocks for CPU-bound tasks
- Automatic work distribution across cores
- Thread-safe data structures

### Concurrent Execution
- `concurrent` blocks for I/O-bound tasks
- Channels for communication between tasks
- Atomic operations for shared state

### Asynchronous Programming
- `async`/`await` for non-blocking operations
- Future/Promise-based concurrency
- Structured concurrency with scoped tasks

## Error Handling

### Result Types ✅ SYNTAX IMPLEMENTED
- `int?ErrorType` for operations that might fail ✅
- `Option<T>` (Some | None) for values that might be absent ✅
- `?` operator for error propagation ✅
- Pattern matching for handling different outcomes (syntax exists, VM pending)

## Code Organization

### Modules and Imports ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Module system for code organization ✅
- Explicit imports: `import module as alias` ✅
- Import filtering: `show`, `hide` filters ✅
- Module caching and error handling ✅
- Visibility controls (`@public`, `@private`, `@protected`) - planned

### Interfaces and Traits
- Interfaces for defining behavior contracts
- Traits for adding behavior to existing types
- Mixins for code reuse

## Syntax Design

### Readability
- Braces for blocks
- Semicolons for statement termination
- Type annotations after identifiers (`name: type`)

### Expressiveness ✅ MOSTLY IMPLEMENTED
- String interpolation with `{variable}` ✅
- Optional parameters: `fn greet(name: str?)` ✅
- Default parameter values: `fn greet(name: str = "World")` ✅
- Pattern matching with `match` expressions (syntax exists, VM pending)
- Named arguments for function calls (planned)
