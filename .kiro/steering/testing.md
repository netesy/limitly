# Testing and Debugging Guide

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions
- Use test fixtures for common setup

### Integration Testing
- Test interaction between components
- Verify correct data flow through the system
- Test end-to-end functionality

### Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementing features
- Use tests to guide design decisions
- Refactor with confidence

## Testing Tools

### Parser Testing
- `test_parser` executable for testing the parser
- Verify AST structure matches expected output
- Test error handling and recovery

### VM Testing
- Test bytecode generation and execution
- Verify correct execution of language features
- Test memory management and garbage collection

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark critical operations
- Compare against baseline implementations
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## Debugging Techniques

### AST Visualization
- Print AST structure for debugging
- Verify correct parsing of language constructs
- Identify issues in the parser

### Bytecode Disassembly
- Print bytecode instructions for debugging
- Verify correct code generation
- Identify issues in the backend

### VM Tracing
- Step-by-step execution of bytecode
- Inspect stack and environment state
- Track memory allocations and deallocations

## Error Handling

### Compile-Time Errors
- Syntax errors from the parser
- Type errors from the type checker
- Semantic errors from the analyzer

### Runtime Errors
- Division by zero
- Null reference
- Out of bounds access
- Stack overflow
- Memory allocation failure

### Error Reporting
- Clear error messages with context
- Line and column information
- Suggestions for fixing errors

## Debugging Tools

### Memory Analyzer
- Track memory allocations and deallocations
- Detect memory leaks
- Verify correct garbage collection

### Profiler
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Measure execution time of operations
- Optimize critical paths

### Debugger Integration
- Set breakpoints in source code
- Inspect variables and stack frames
- Step through execution

## Test Cases

### Language Features
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Function declarations and calls
- Control flow statements
- Expressions and operators
- Classes and objects
- Error handling
- Concurrency primitives

### Edge Cases
- Empty programs
- Very large programs
- Deeply nested expressions
- Recursive functions
- Complex type hierarchies
- Resource-intensive operations
