# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the transformation of the Limit programming language parser from a token-driven architecture to a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) based architecture. The current parser discards whitespace and comments during parsing, making it difficult to implement advanced tooling features like code formatting, syntax highlighting, incremental parsing, and robust error recovery. The CST-based approach will preserve all syntactic and lexical details while maintaining the ability to generate clean, typed ASTs for compilation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Lexical Preservation

**User Story:** As a language tool developer, I want the parser to preserve all lexical information including whitespace and comments, so that I can implement formatting tools and syntax highlighting that maintain the original source structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scanner processes source code THEN it SHALL emit tokens for all whitespace characters including spaces, tabs, and newlines
2. WHEN the scanner encounters comments THEN it SHALL emit comment tokens with types COMMENT_LINE and COMMENT_BLOCK
3. WHEN the scanner encounters invalid characters THEN it SHALL emit ERROR tokens and continue scanning
4. WHEN tokens are emitted THEN they SHALL maintain their exact lexical order from the source
5. IF trivia attachment is implemented THEN leading and trailing trivia SHALL be associated with meaningful tokens

### Requirement 2: Concrete Syntax Tree Structure

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want a unified CST node structure that represents the exact syntactic structure of the source code, so that I can build tools that work with the concrete syntax rather than abstract semantics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CST node is created THEN it SHALL contain a NodeKind identifier, children nodes, and direct tokens
2. WHEN CST nodes are constructed THEN they SHALL preserve lexical order of all children and tokens
3. WHEN invalid or incomplete syntax is encountered THEN CST nodes SHALL be created with missing or error elements
4. WHEN CST nodes are created THEN they SHALL optionally track source span information (start_pos, end_pos)
5. IF validation is performed THEN CST nodes MAY include validity flags or metadata

### Requirement 3: Error-Tolerant Parsing

**User Story:** As a developer using an IDE, I want the parser to continue parsing even when there are syntax errors, so that I can get meaningful feedback and tooling support for partially correct code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parser encounters syntax errors THEN it SHALL create partial CST nodes rather than aborting
2. WHEN required tokens are missing THEN the parser SHALL insert placeholder or error nodes
3. WHEN the parser cannot recover from an error THEN it SHALL skip to synchronization points (semicolons, braces, newlines)
4. WHEN tokens are skipped during error recovery THEN they SHALL be wrapped in InvalidNode or ErrorNode structures
5. WHEN parsing completes THEN a CST SHALL be produced regardless of syntax errors

### Requirement 4: CST to AST Transformation

**User Story:** As a compiler backend developer, I want a clean transformation layer from CST to typed AST, so that I can maintain the existing compilation pipeline while benefiting from the enhanced parsing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CST is transformed to AST THEN a separate transformation pass SHALL traverse the CST
2. WHEN required CST elements are missing THEN Error or Missing AST nodes SHALL be inserted
3. WHEN AST nodes are created THEN they SHALL maintain source mapping information for error reporting
4. WHEN transformation encounters invalid CST structures THEN it SHALL produce error-tolerant AST nodes
5. IF validation is required THEN an optional validation pass SHALL mark incomplete constructs

### Requirement 5: Development and Debugging Tools

**User Story:** As a language developer, I want comprehensive debugging and visualization tools for the CST, so that I can understand parser behavior and debug parsing issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CST debugging is needed THEN a printCST function SHALL provide indented visualization of nodes and tokens
2. WHEN CST analysis is required THEN serialization to JSON or debug format SHALL be available
3. WHEN CST traversal is needed THEN utilities SHALL provide forEachChild, getTokens, and getText functions
4. WHEN code formatting is required THEN CST SHALL enable lossless source reconstruction
5. IF error recovery debugging is enabled THEN diagnostics SHALL be provided for missing or invalid nodes

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the CST transformation to be implemented incrementally without breaking existing functionality, so that the language remains stable during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CST system is implemented THEN existing AST-based compilation SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN parser changes are made THEN they SHALL be implemented in phases with clear migration steps
3. WHEN CST is introduced THEN the existing token-based parser MAY be maintained temporarily for comparison
4. WHEN integration is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
5. IF performance regression occurs THEN it SHALL be within acceptable bounds (< 20% slowdown)

### Requirement 7: Advanced Tooling Support

**User Story:** As an IDE developer, I want the CST to support advanced language server features, so that I can implement incremental parsing, syntax highlighting, and code completion effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source code changes THEN CST SHALL support incremental re-parsing of modified sections
2. WHEN syntax highlighting is requested THEN CST SHALL provide token-level information with context
3. WHEN code completion is triggered THEN CST SHALL provide partial parse trees for incomplete expressions
4. WHEN code folding is requested THEN CST SHALL identify foldable regions (blocks, comments, imports)
5. IF formatting is applied THEN CST SHALL enable round-trip source reconstruction with modified whitespace
