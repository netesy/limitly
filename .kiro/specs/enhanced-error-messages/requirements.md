# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the debug and error messaging system in the Limit programming language to provide more direct, informational, and useful error messages. The current error messages lack context, specific error codes, and helpful suggestions for developers. The enhanced system will follow modern compiler error message patterns with structured formatting, error codes, contextual information, and actionable suggestions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Limit programming language, I want to receive clear and structured error messages with specific error codes, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues in my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a syntax error occurs THEN the system SHALL display an error message with a unique error code in the format `error[E###][ErrorType]`
2. WHEN an error is displayed THEN the system SHALL include the specific problematic token or symbol
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL show the file path and exact line/column location using the format `--> filepath:line:column`
4. WHEN displaying an error THEN the system SHALL show the relevant source code line with visual indicators pointing to the problem location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging code, I want error messages to include contextual hints and suggestions, so that I can understand not just what went wrong but how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a common syntax error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a "Hint" section with explanatory text about the likely cause
2. WHEN applicable THEN the system SHALL provide a "Suggestion" section with specific recommendations for fixing the error
3. WHEN an error has a root cause elsewhere in the code THEN the system SHALL include a "Caused by" section showing the related context
4. WHEN multiple related errors exist THEN the system SHALL group them logically and show their relationships

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with complex code structures, I want error messages to show the broader context of where errors occur, so that I can understand the scope and impact of the problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs within a block structure THEN the system SHALL show where the containing block starts
2. WHEN displaying source context THEN the system SHALL show line numbers for easy reference
3. WHEN an error spans multiple lines THEN the system SHALL display all relevant lines with appropriate visual indicators
4. WHEN showing context THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific problematic area using visual markers like `^` or `~~~`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using an IDE or text editor, I want error messages to be machine-readable and consistently formatted, so that development tools can parse and display them effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating error messages THEN the system SHALL use a consistent structured format that can be parsed by IDEs
2. WHEN outputting errors THEN the system SHALL include all necessary metadata (file, line, column, error type, code)
3. WHEN multiple errors exist THEN the system SHALL output them in a consistent format that allows for batch processing
4. WHEN displaying errors THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing error parsing tools

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer learning the Limit language, I want error messages to be educational and help me understand language concepts, so that I can improve my coding skills over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a language-specific error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide educational context about the relevant language feature
2. WHEN showing suggestions THEN the system SHALL explain why the suggested fix is appropriate
3. WHEN displaying hints THEN the system SHALL reference relevant documentation or language concepts where applicable
4. WHEN an error involves advanced language features THEN the system SHALL provide simplified explanations for beginners
