# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the virtual machine execution support for concurrent and parallel blocks with integrated error handling. The language syntax and AST nodes are already defined, but the VM execution engine needs to be implemented to support:

1. **Concurrent blocks** for I/O-bound tasks with batch, stream, and async modes
2. **Parallel blocks** for CPU-bound tasks with work distribution
3. **Task and worker statements** within concurrent/parallel blocks
4. **Error handling integration** with fallible expressions and ?else
5. **Channel-based communication** between tasks
6. **Atomic operations** for thread-safe shared state

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Concurrent Block Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute concurrent blocks with task statements, so that I can run I/O-bound operations concurrently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a concurrent block is encountered THEN the VM SHALL create a thread pool for task execution
2. WHEN a task statement with iteration is encountered THEN the VM SHALL spawn separate tasks for each iteration
3. WHEN tasks complete THEN the VM SHALL collect results and continue execution
4. WHEN no parameters are specified THEN the VM SHALL use default values (mode=batch, cores=Auto, on_error=Stop)
5. WHEN a channel parameter is specified THEN the VM SHALL create a channel for task communication

### Requirement 2: Basic Parallel Block Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute parallel blocks with task statements, so that I can run CPU-bound operations in parallel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a parallel block is encountered THEN the VM SHALL create a work-stealing thread pool
2. WHEN tasks are CPU-bound THEN the VM SHALL distribute work across available cores
3. WHEN mode=batch is specified THEN the VM SHALL execute all tasks and wait for completion
4. WHEN cores parameter is specified THEN the VM SHALL limit thread pool size accordingly
5. WHEN tasks complete THEN the VM SHALL synchronize results before continuing

### Requirement 3: Task Statement Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define task statements with iteration, so that I can create multiple concurrent/parallel tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task statement has an iteration variable THEN the VM SHALL create one task per iteration
2. WHEN a task accesses the iteration variable THEN the VM SHALL provide the correct value for each task
3. WHEN tasks execute concurrently THEN the VM SHALL ensure thread-safe access to shared variables
4. WHEN a task completes THEN the VM SHALL clean up task-specific resources
5. WHEN tasks throw errors THEN the VM SHALL handle them according to the on_error parameter

### Requirement 4: Worker Statement Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define worker statements for stream processing, so that I can process incoming data streams concurrently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker statement is encountered THEN the VM SHALL create a worker function
2. WHEN mode=stream is specified THEN the VM SHALL process input stream items through workers
3. WHEN workers receive input THEN the VM SHALL pass the correct parameter to each worker
4. WHEN workers complete THEN the VM SHALL send results to the output channel
5. WHEN the input stream ends THEN the VM SHALL terminate all workers gracefully

### Requirement 5: Atomic Variable Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use atomic variables in concurrent contexts, so that I can safely share state between tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an atomic variable is declared THEN the VM SHALL create a thread-safe atomic wrapper
2. WHEN atomic variables are accessed from multiple tasks THEN the VM SHALL ensure atomic operations
3. WHEN atomic variables are incremented THEN the VM SHALL use atomic add operations
4. WHEN atomic variables are read THEN the VM SHALL return consistent values
5. WHEN atomic variables are assigned THEN the VM SHALL use atomic store operations

### Requirement 6: Channel Communication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use channels for task communication, so that I can pass data between concurrent tasks safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a channel is created THEN the VM SHALL provide a thread-safe communication mechanism
2. WHEN tasks send to a channel THEN the VM SHALL queue messages in order
3. WHEN tasks receive from a channel THEN the VM SHALL provide messages in FIFO order
4. WHEN a channel is closed THEN the VM SHALL notify all waiting receivers
5. WHEN iterating over a channel THEN the VM SHALL provide all available messages

### Requirement 7: Error Handling Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling to work within concurrent blocks, so that I can handle failures gracefully in concurrent contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN on_error=Stop is specified THEN the VM SHALL terminate all tasks on first error
2. WHEN on_error=Auto is specified THEN the VM SHALL continue with remaining tasks after errors
3. WHEN on_error=Retry is specified THEN the VM SHALL retry failed tasks up to a limit
4. WHEN tasks throw errors THEN the VM SHALL propagate them according to the error handling strategy
5. WHEN attempt blocks are used in tasks THEN the VM SHALL handle errors locally within tasks

### Requirement 8: Timeout and Grace Period Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify timeouts for concurrent blocks, so that I can prevent indefinite blocking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timeout parameter is specified THEN the VM SHALL enforce the timeout limit
2. WHEN timeout is reached THEN the VM SHALL initiate graceful shutdown
3. WHEN grace parameter is specified THEN the VM SHALL allow tasks to complete within grace period
4. WHEN on_timeout=partial is specified THEN the VM SHALL return partial results after timeout
5. WHEN grace period expires THEN the VM SHALL forcefully terminate remaining tasks

### Requirement 9: Async/Await Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use async/await within concurrent blocks, so that I can handle asynchronous operations properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN await expressions are encountered THEN the VM SHALL suspend task execution
2. WHEN awaited operations complete THEN the VM SHALL resume task execution with results
3. WHEN async functions are called THEN the VM SHALL return futures/promises
4. WHEN multiple await operations occur THEN the VM SHALL handle them sequentially within tasks
5. WHEN await operations fail THEN the VM SHALL propagate errors according to error handling strategy

### Requirement 10: Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper resource cleanup in concurrent blocks, so that I don't have memory leaks or resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent blocks complete THEN the VM SHALL clean up all thread pool resources
2. WHEN tasks are cancelled THEN the VM SHALL clean up task-specific resources
3. WHEN channels are closed THEN the VM SHALL release channel memory
4. WHEN atomic variables go out of scope THEN the VM SHALL clean up atomic wrappers
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the VM SHALL ensure proper resource cleanup during unwinding
