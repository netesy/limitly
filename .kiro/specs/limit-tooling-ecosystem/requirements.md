# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Limit Tooling Ecosystem is a comprehensive suite of development tools designed to provide a seamless, integrated development experience for the Limit programming language. This ecosystem will transform Limit from a language implementation into a complete development platform with all essential tools working together through a unified interface. The tooling will support both new project creation and integration with existing codebases, providing developers with everything needed for professional software development in Limit.

3. WHEN resolving dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle version conflicts and provide clear resolution strategies
4. WHEN a developer runs `limitly deps tree` THEN the system SHALL display the complete dependency graph
5. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and run tests to ensure nothing breaks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Limit developer, I want a build system that compiles my code efficiently with proper optimization, so that I can create performant executables with minimal build times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `limitly build` THEN the system SHALL compile all source files into an executable
2. WHEN building incrementally THEN the system SHALL only recompile changed files and their dependents
3. WHEN building with different configurations THEN the system SHALL support debug, release, and custom build profiles
4. WHEN cross-compiling THEN the system SHALL support multiple target platforms and architectures
5. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide precise error locations and suggested fixes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Limit developer, I want a comprehensive testing framework, so that I can write reliable tests and ensure code quality with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `limitly test` THEN the system SHALL discover and execute all test files automatically
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide detailed assertion utilities and clear failure messages
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate code coverage reports with line-by-line analysis
4. WHEN running tests in parallel THEN the system SHALL execute tests concurrently for improved performance
5. WHEN integrating with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL output machine-readable test results and coverage data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Limit developer, I want code linting and formatting tools, so that my code follows consistent style guidelines and is free from common issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `limitly lint` THEN the system SHALL analyze code for style violations and potential bugs
2. WHEN a developer runs `limitly format` THEN the system SHALL automatically format code according to configured rules
3. WHEN linting detects issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific suggestions for fixing each problem
4. WHEN formatting code THEN the system SHALL preserve semantic meaning while enforcing consistent style
5. WHEN integrated with version control THEN the system SHALL run as pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Limit developer, I want debugging tools that help me understand program execution, so that I can efficiently identify and fix issues in my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `limitly debug <program>` THEN the system SHALL start an interactive debugging session
2. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL support setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables
