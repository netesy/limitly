# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Limit programming language's pattern matching capabilities with comprehensive destructuring support and error handling integration, while implementing zero-cost loop abstractions. The enhanced match expressions will support tuple destructuring, struct field extraction, array pattern matching, and seamless error handling patterns. Additionally, loop constructs will be optimized to compile to efficient machine code with no runtime overhead compared to manual iteration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to destructure tuples and arrays in match patterns, so that I can extract multiple values in a single pattern match operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `match expr` with tuple patterns THEN the system SHALL support `(a, b, c)` patterns to extract tuple elements
2. WHEN I use `match expr` with array patterns THEN the system SHALL support `[first, second, ...rest]` patterns for array destructuring
3. WHEN I use `match expr` with nested patterns THEN the system SHALL support `(a, [b, c])` for nested destructuring
4. WHEN destructuring patterns don't match the structure THEN the system SHALL produce compile-time errors with clear messages
5. WHEN using wildcard patterns THEN the system SHALL support `_` to ignore specific elements in destructuring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to destructure custom types and structs in match patterns, so that I can extract fields and properties efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `match expr` on struct types THEN the system SHALL support `StructName { field1, field2 }` patterns
2. WHEN I use `match expr` on enum variants THEN the system SHALL support `EnumVariant(value)` and `EnumVariant { field }` patterns
3. WHEN I use partial struct destructuring THEN the system SHALL support `StructName { field1, .. }` to ignore remaining fields
4. WHEN I use field renaming in patterns THEN the system SHALL support `StructName { field1: newName }` syntax
5. WHEN struct patterns don't match available fields THEN the system SHALL produce compile-time errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced error handling patterns in match expressions, so that I can handle complex error scenarios with destructuring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `match expr` on error unions THEN the system SHALL support `Ok(value)` and `Err(error)` patterns
2. WHEN I use `match expr` on typed errors THEN the system SHALL support `Err(ErrorType { field1, field2 })` destructuring
3. WHEN I use nested error patterns THEN the system SHALL support `Ok((a, b))` and `Err(CustomError(details))` patterns
4. WHEN error patterns are incomplete THEN the system SHALL require exhaustive matching with compile-time validation
5. WHEN using error propagation in patterns THEN the system SHALL support `val?` patterns for automatic unwrapping

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want guard clauses in match patterns, so that I can add conditional logic to pattern matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use guard clauses THEN the system SHALL support `pattern if condition` syntax
2. WHEN multiple patterns have guards THEN the system SHALL evaluate them in order until one matches
3. WHEN guard conditions use pattern variables THEN the system SHALL have access to destructured values
4. WHEN no guarded patterns match THEN the system SHALL continue to the next pattern or produce a match failure
5. WHEN guard expressions have side effects THEN the system SHALL evaluate them only when the pattern matches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want zero-cost loop abstractions, so that high-level iteration constructs compile to efficient machine code without runtime overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `for` loops with ranges THEN the system SHALL compile to simple counter loops without iterator objects
2. WHEN I use `iter` loops with collections THEN the system SHALL inline iteration logic and eliminate bounds checking where safe
3. WHEN I use nested loops THEN the system SHALL optimize loop fusion and eliminate temporary allocations
4. WHEN I use functional iteration methods THEN the system SHALL inline map/filter/reduce operations into single loops
5. WHEN loops have compile-time known bounds THEN the system SHALL unroll small loops automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want compile-time loop analysis and optimization, so that the compiler can detect and optimize common iteration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loops access arrays with known bounds THEN the system SHALL eliminate bounds checking
2. WHEN loops have no side effects THEN the system SHALL enable vectorization and parallelization hints
3. WHEN loops can be proven to terminate THEN the system SHALL optimize based on termination guarantees
4. WHEN loops access memory sequentially THEN the system SHALL optimize for cache locality and prefetching
5. WHEN loops contain invariant computations THEN the system SHALL hoist invariants outside the loop body

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pattern matching to integrate seamlessly with the type system, so that patterns provide type narrowing and inference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I match on union types THEN the system SHALL narrow the type in each branch based on the pattern
2. WHEN I use destructuring patterns THEN the system SHALL infer types for extracted variables
3. WHEN patterns are exhaustive THEN the system SHALL verify completeness at compile time
4. WHEN patterns overlap THEN the system SHALL warn about unreachable patterns
5. WHEN pattern variables shadow outer scope THEN the system SHALL provide clear scoping rules and warnings
