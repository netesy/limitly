# CST Parser Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CST (Concrete Syntax Tree) parser is currently failing with memory allocation errors (`std::bad_alloc`) when parsing test files, while the legacy parser works correctly but has some parsing issues. This specification addresses fixing the CST parser to be accurate, memory-efficient, and compatible with all existing test files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory Management and Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CST parser to handle large files without crashing, so that I can parse any valid Limit language file reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing any test file THEN the CST parser SHALL NOT throw `std::bad_alloc` or other memory-related exceptions
2. WHEN parsing files with complex nested structures THEN the parser SHALL manage memory efficiently using RAII principles
3. WHEN encountering parsing errors THEN the parser SHALL recover gracefully without memory leaks
4. WHEN parsing large files THEN memory usage SHALL grow linearly with file size, not exponentially
5. IF memory allocation fails THEN the parser SHALL report a clear error message and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2: Parsing Accuracy and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CST parser to produce the same parsing results as the legacy parser, so that I can trust the CST parser for all language features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing string interpolation with `&&` and `||` operators THEN the parser SHALL correctly handle these operators within interpolation expressions
2. WHEN parsing `elif` statements THEN the parser SHALL recognize `elif` as a keyword, not a function call
3. WHEN parsing object literal syntax like `Some { kind: "Some", value: 42 }` THEN the parser SHALL correctly parse the object structure
4. WHEN parsing all test files in the `tests/` directory THEN the CST parser SHALL produce equivalent results to the legacy parser
5. WHEN encountering syntax errors THEN the parser SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 3: Trivia Preservation and CST Completeness

**User Story:** As a tool developer, I want the CST parser to preserve all source code information including whitespace and comments, so that I can build accurate code formatting and refactoring tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing source code THEN the CST SHALL preserve all whitespace tokens between meaningful tokens
2. WHEN parsing source code with comments THEN the CST SHALL preserve all comment tokens with their exact content
3. WHEN reconstructing source code from CST THEN the output SHALL be identical to the original input
4. WHEN parsing incomplete or erroneous code THEN the CST SHALL still preserve trivia information where possible
5. WHEN accessing trivia information THEN the API SHALL provide efficient access to leading and trailing trivia for each node

### Requirement 4: Error Recovery and Robustness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CST parser to continue parsing after encountering errors, so that I can get comprehensive error reporting and partial parsing results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering a syntax error THEN the parser SHALL report the error and attempt to continue parsing
2. WHEN multiple syntax errors exist THEN the parser SHALL report all errors up to a reasonable limit (100 errors)
3. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the parser SHALL synchronize at statement boundaries or other logical points
4. WHEN creating partial nodes for incomplete constructs THEN the nodes SHALL be clearly marked as incomplete
5. WHEN error recovery fails THEN the parser SHALL provide context about what it was trying to parse

### Requirement 5: Performance and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CST parser to be reasonably fast, so that it doesn't significantly slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing typical source files THEN the CST parser SHALL complete parsing within 2x the time of the legacy parser
2. WHEN parsing the same file multiple times THEN the parser SHALL show consistent performance
3. WHEN using memoization THEN frequently accessed parsing rules SHALL be cached appropriately
4. WHEN parsing in direct AST mode THEN performance SHALL be comparable to the legacy parser
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds reasonable limits THEN the parser SHALL provide warnings or fail gracefully

### Requirement 6: API Compatibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily switch between CST and legacy parsers, so that I can test and compare parsing results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the test_parser utility THEN both `-cst` and `-legacy` flags SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN comparing parser outputs THEN the CST parser SHALL provide equivalent AST structures to the legacy parser
3. WHEN accessing parsing results THEN the API SHALL provide clear methods to get CST nodes, AST nodes, or error information
4. WHEN switching parser modes THEN the interface SHALL be consistent and intuitive
5. WHEN debugging parsing issues THEN the parser SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information

### Requirement 7: Test Coverage and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the CST parser, so that I can be confident in its correctness across all language features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running all tests in the `tests/` directory THEN the CST parser SHALL pass all tests that the legacy parser passes
2. WHEN testing specific language features THEN each feature SHALL have dedicated CST parser tests
3. WHEN comparing CST and legacy parser outputs THEN automated tests SHALL verify equivalence
4. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the CST parser SHALL handle errors as well as or better than the legacy parser
5. WHEN running performance benchmarks THEN the CST parser SHALL meet performance requirements consistently
