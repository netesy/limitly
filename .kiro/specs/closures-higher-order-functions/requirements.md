# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces closures and higher-order functions to the Limit programming language, along with a comprehensive set of builtin functions. Closures allow functions to capture variables from their enclosing scope, enabling powerful functional programming patterns. Higher-order functions can accept other functions as parameters or return functions as results. The builtin functions will provide essential functional programming utilities like map, filter, reduce, and more.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create closures that capture variables from their enclosing scope, so that I can write more flexible and reusable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function is defined inside another function THEN the inner function SHALL capture variables from the outer function's scope
2. WHEN a closure is returned from a function THEN the captured variables SHALL remain accessible even after the outer function returns
3. WHEN a closure modifies a captured variable THEN the change SHALL be visible to other closures that capture the same variable
4. WHEN a closure captures a variable by value THEN modifications to the original variable SHALL NOT affect the captured value
5. WHEN a closure captures a variable by reference THEN modifications to the original variable SHALL affect the captured value

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to pass functions as arguments to other functions, so that I can create flexible and composable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function accepts another function as a parameter THEN the parameter SHALL be callable within the function body
2. WHEN a function is passed as an argument THEN it SHALL retain its original behavior and captured variables
3. WHEN a higher-order function calls a function parameter THEN the call SHALL execute with the correct arguments and return the expected result
4. WHEN a function parameter has a specific signature THEN the type system SHALL enforce that only compatible functions can be passed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to return functions from other functions, so that I can create function factories and curried functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function returns another function THEN the returned function SHALL be callable
2. WHEN a function factory creates functions with different behaviors THEN each returned function SHALL maintain its unique behavior
3. WHEN a function returns a closure THEN the closure SHALL retain access to the factory function's variables
4. WHEN currying is implemented THEN partial application SHALL work correctly with multiple argument levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to essential builtin higher-order functions, so that I can perform common functional programming operations without implementing them myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using map function THEN it SHALL apply a transformation function to each element of a collection and return a new collection
2. WHEN using filter function THEN it SHALL return a new collection containing only elements that satisfy a predicate function
3. WHEN using reduce function THEN it SHALL accumulate values using a reducer function and return a single result
4. WHEN using forEach function THEN it SHALL execute a function for each element without returning a new collection
5. WHEN using find function THEN it SHALL return the first element that satisfies a predicate function
6. WHEN using some function THEN it SHALL return true if at least one element satisfies a predicate function
7. WHEN using every function THEN it SHALL return true if all elements satisfy a predicate function

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want builtin functions to be organized in a separate module, so that the core language remains clean and the builtins are easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builtin functions are implemented THEN they SHALL be defined in a separate source file
2. WHEN the VM starts THEN builtin functions SHALL be automatically available without explicit imports
3. WHEN builtin functions are called THEN they SHALL have the same performance characteristics as native VM operations
4. WHEN new builtin functions are added THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming and behavior patterns
5. WHEN builtin functions handle errors THEN they SHALL integrate with the language's error handling system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want lambda expressions for creating anonymous functions, so that I can write concise functional code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing a lambda expression THEN it SHALL create an anonymous function with the specified parameters and body
2. WHEN a lambda captures variables THEN it SHALL behave like a closure with proper variable capture
3. WHEN a lambda is used as a function argument THEN it SHALL be compatible with higher-order function parameters
4. WHEN lambda syntax is used THEN it SHALL be more concise than full function declarations for simple operations
5. WHEN lambdas are nested THEN each level SHALL properly capture variables from its respective scope

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper memory management for closures, so that captured variables are properly cleaned up when no longer needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a closure captures variables THEN the memory for captured variables SHALL be managed automatically
2. WHEN all references to a closure are removed THEN the captured variables SHALL be eligible for garbage collection
3. WHEN closures create circular references THEN the memory management system SHALL handle them correctly
4. WHEN closures capture large objects THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized to avoid unnecessary duplication
5. WHEN the VM shuts down THEN all closure-related memory SHALL be properly released
