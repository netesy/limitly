# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete integration of classes into the Limit programming language, ensuring they work seamlessly with all existing language features including error handling (`?` operator), pattern matching (`match` expressions), the type system (union types, Option types), modules, and concurrency primitives. The goal is to make classes first-class citizens in the language with full feature parity and integration.
