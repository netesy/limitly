# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive type system for the Limit programming language that supports primitive types, type aliases, union types, generic containers, and advanced type constructs like Option and Result types. The type system will provide static type checking, type inference, and runtime type safety while maintaining performance and expressiveness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use primitive type aliases so that I can create domain-specific types that improve code readability and type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I declare a type alias like `type date = i64` THEN the system SHALL treat `date` as a distinct type from `i64`
2. WHEN I declare multiple primitive type aliases THEN the system SHALL support `i64`, `u64`, `f64`, `bool`, and `str` as base types
3. WHEN I use a type alias in variable declarations THEN the system SHALL enforce type compatibility
4. WHEN I attempt to assign incompatible types THEN the system SHALL report a compile-time error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create union types so that I can represent values that can be one of several types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I declare a union type like `type Option = Some | None` THEN the system SHALL allow variables of that type to hold either variant
2. WHEN I use union types with structured variants THEN the system SHALL support variants with different field structures
3. WHEN I access union type values THEN the system SHALL require pattern matching or type checking to safely access variant data
4. WHEN I declare nested union types THEN the system SHALL properly handle complex type hierarchies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Option and Result types so that I can handle nullable values and error conditions in a type-safe manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I declare an Option type THEN the system SHALL support `Some` variant with a value and `None` variant for absence
2. WHEN I declare a Result type THEN the system SHALL support `Success` variant with a value and `Error` variant with error information
3. WHEN I use Option or Result types THEN the system SHALL enforce proper handling of both variants
4. WHEN I access Option or Result values THEN the system SHALL require explicit handling of all possible variants

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use generic container types so that I can create type-safe collections and data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I declare dictionary types like `{ int: float }` THEN the system SHALL enforce key-value type constraints
2. WHEN I declare list types like `[str]` THEN the system SHALL enforce element type constraints
3. WHEN I use generic containers THEN the system SHALL support type parameters for reusable container definitions
4. WHEN I access container elements THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety for all operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use structured types so that I can define complex data structures with named fields and type constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I declare structured types with named fields THEN the system SHALL enforce field type constraints
2. WHEN I access structured type fields THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time field existence checking
3. WHEN I create instances of structured types THEN the system SHALL require all required fields to be provided
4. WHEN I use structured types in type aliases THEN the system SHALL support composition and nesting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive type checking so that I can catch type errors at compile time rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I compile code with type mismatches THEN the system SHALL report clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN I use undefined types THEN the system SHALL report compile-time errors with suggestions
3. WHEN I perform operations on incompatible types THEN the system SHALL prevent compilation
4. WHEN I use proper type annotations THEN the system SHALL validate type consistency across the entire program

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type inference capabilities so that I can write concise code without sacrificing type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I declare variables without explicit types THEN the system SHALL infer types from initialization values
2. WHEN I use type aliases in expressions THEN the system SHALL properly infer the aliased types
3. WHEN I use generic containers THEN the system SHALL infer element types from usage context
4. WHEN type inference is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL require explicit type annotations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want runtime type safety so that I can safely work with union types and dynamic type checking when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use union types at runtime THEN the system SHALL provide safe type discrimination mechanisms
2. WHEN I perform pattern matching on union types THEN the system SHALL ensure exhaustive case coverage
3. WHEN I access variant fields THEN the system SHALL prevent access to fields that don't exist in the current variant
4. WHEN I need runtime type information THEN the system SHALL provide introspection capabilities for debugging and reflection
